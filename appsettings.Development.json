    Development override — Windows dev machine.

    The base appsettings.json connection string points to the Linux Simba driver path:
      Driver=/opt/simba/spark/lib/64/libsparkodbc_sb64.so

    On Windows the driver is registered by name in the ODBC Data Source Administrator.
    This file overrides the full connection string with the Windows driver name instead.

    ASP.NET Core merges appsettings.json → appsettings.Development.json automatically
    when ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development (the default for local runs in VS / Rider).

    Setup on Windows:
      1. Download and install: Simba Spark ODBC Driver 2.x (64-bit)
         https://www.databricks.com/spark/odbc-drivers-download
      2. Confirm the driver name appears in:
         Control Panel → Administrative Tools → ODBC Data Sources (64-bit) → Drivers tab
      3. Fill in your token below or set via user secrets:
         dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:Databricks" "Driver={Simba Spark ODBC Driver};...;PWD=dapi...;"
